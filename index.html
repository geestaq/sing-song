			<h1>Sound of silence</h1>
			<p>
				Hello darkness, my old friend,<br>
				I've come to talk with you again,<br>
				Because a vision softly creeping,<br>
				Left its seeds while I was sleeping,<br>
				And the vision that was planted in my brain<br>
				Still remains<br>
				Within the sound of silence.
			</p>
			<p>
				In restless dreams I walked alone <br>
				Narrow streets of cobblestone,<br>
				'Neath the halo of a street lamp,<br>
				I turned my collar to the cold and damp<br>
				When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light<br>
				That split the night<br>
				And touched the sound of silence.
			</p>
